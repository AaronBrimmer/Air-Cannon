# Air Cannon
This project uses sections of 3in PVC pipe and a ball valve to create a powerful cannon, for t-shirts and other items. 

# The cannon
The primary tank of the cannon is built from 3in pvc pipe. Various fittings were used to step down to a 1/2in pvc ball valve. The barrel is also 3in threaded into the ball valve with fittings. At the end of the tank, a female pressure quick connect and pressure gauge are attached. This is sealed by another ball valve with a male pressure quick connect for pressure filling

# The electronics
The cannon has a removable lighted barrel and electronics box attachment. 

The barrel has three strips of 27 led WS2812B individually addressable leds. This is covered with a layer of toilet paper (as a diffuser) and a single layer printed PETG cover to diffuse more and protect from water. 

These are run off an ardiuno nano that control the leds with three inputs (potentiometer for brightness, button to fire, switch to toggle). These are powered from a 5-32v to 5v converter with a 12v battery.
